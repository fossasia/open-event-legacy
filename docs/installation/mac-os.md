## Dependencies required to run Orga Server

* Python 2

* Installation of 'Homebrew' would catalyze the process of installation
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew doctor
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

* Postgres
```sh
brew update
brew install postgres
```
* NodeJS
```sh
brew install node
```

## Steps

Make sure you have the dependencies mentioned above installed before proceeding further.

Run the commands mentioned below with the terminal active in the project's root directory.

You may encounter problems installing 'libevent' while executing the requirements.txt..

Installing the below files would prevent the 'egg_info' error.

```sh
brew install python libevent
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python
pip install gevent gunicorn
```

* **Step 1** - Install python requirements.

```sh
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```


* **Step 2** - Create the database. For that we first open the psql shell.

```sh
psql
```

* When inside psql, create a user for open-event and then using the user create the database.

```sql
create user john with password 'test';
create database oevent with owner=john;
```

* Once database is created, exit the psql shell with `\q` followed by ENTER.


* **Step 3** - Install bower and frontend requirements.

```sh
npm install bower -g
bower install
```


* **Step 4** - Create application environment variables.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```


* **Step 5** - Start the postgres service on the application manually.


* **Step 6** - Create the tables. For that we will use `create_db.py`.

```sh
python create_db.py
# enter email and password
python manage.py db stamp head
```


* **Step 7** - Start the application along with the needed services.
The `&` at the end of the commands below make them run in background so that they don't hold the terminal.

```sh
# download and run redis
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
rm redis-3.2.1.tar.gz
cd redis-3.2.1
make

# To run redis
redis-3.2.1/src/redis-server &

# run worker
export INTEGRATE_SOCKETIO=false
# socketio has problems with celery "blocking" tasks
# also socketio is not used in a celery task so no problem to turn it off
celery worker -A app.celery &
unset INTEGRATE_SOCKETIO

# run app
python manage.py runserver
```

* **Step 8** - Rejoice. Go to `localhost:5000` in your web browser to see the application live.
